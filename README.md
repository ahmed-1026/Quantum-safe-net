# QuantumSafeNet

With the global shift towards remote work, traditional Virtual Network solutions face increasing challenges in securing organizational assets against sophisticated cyber threats. Moreover, the advent of quantum computing in the future poses a significant risk to current encryption standards. 

"QuantumSafeNet" addresses these issues by integrating AI-powered security, post-quantum cryptography, geo-location filtering, blockchain-based secure audits, and dynamic access controls, ensuring organizations can provide secure remote access now and in the future.

This project aims to build a Virtual Network solution that offers robust security features, scalability, and seamless user experience while incorporating future-proof technologies to address upcoming cybersecurity challenges.

## Key Features:

1. **Secure Remote Access to Organizational Assets:** Remote employees will be able to securely access databases, internal servers, and shared files from any location, ensuring productivity while maintaining security. End-to-end encryption (AES-256) will protect all data transmitted between users and the organization’s internal resources.


2. **AI-Driven Dynamic Trust Model (Trust Score Virtual Network):** An AI-based system will continuously assess the security status of users and devices based on behavior, geolocation, device health, and network conditions. The dynamic "trust score" will adapt access levels in real-time, ensuring that only trusted users with secure devices gain access to sensitive resources.
If the trust score is low, additional authentication layers can be triggered to ensure security.


3. **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for Future-Readiness:** In anticipation of future quantum computing threats, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms will be integrated into the Virtual Network’s encryption mechanisms. This will future-proof the system, ensuring that it remains secure even when quantum computers become capable of breaking current encryption standards.

4. **AI-Powered Threat Detection and Prevention:** AI and machine learning algorithms will be employed to monitor network traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and identify potential threats in real-time. The system will proactively detect suspicious activity, such as malware, data exfiltration, or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, allowing for timely mitigation.
The system will also integrate with existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) for enhanced protection.

5. **Split Tunneling for Optimized Traffic:**
Users will have the option to route specific traffic (such as accessing internal systems) through the Virtual Network, while general internet browsing can bypass it. This feature optimizes bandwidth and ensures that only necessary data is encrypted and tunneled through the Virtual Network, enhancing the user experience.

6. **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Alerts:**
A real-time monitoring system will enable administrators to track network traffic, identify unusual activity, and receive immediate alerts of potential security incidents. This feature ensures proactive defense against security breaches and gives administrators full visibility of the network's health.

7. **Encrypted File Sharing:**
Remote users will be able to securely share files through the Virtual Network with encryption in transit, ensuring that sensitive documents are protected from external threats during transfer.

8. **Centralized Admin Control Panel:**
A web-based or desktop control panel will allow administrators to manage users, configure security policies, and monitor active connections in real time. This centralized system will also provide detailed logs of user activity for security audits and accountability.

9. **Automatic Failover for High Availability:**
In the event of a server failure, the Virtual Network system will automatically switch users to backup servers, ensuring continuous access without downtime. This feature enhances the reliability and availability of the Virtual Network, especially for critical business operations.

10. **Geo-Location Blocking and Filtering:**
The Virtual Network system will allow administrators to enforce geo-location-based filtering, restricting access based on users’ geographical locations. This feature enhances security by blocking connections from high-risk or unauthorized regions, adding an additional layer of access control.

11. **Blockchain for Secure Audits:**
Blockchain technology will be integrated into the Virtual Network system to ensure tamper-proof audit logs. All usage logs, connection data, and security incidents will be recorded on a blockchain, providing an immutable, decentralized record of user activity. This ensures transparency and security for compliance audits and helps prevent log manipulation or tampering.
